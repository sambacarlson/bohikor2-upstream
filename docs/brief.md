# Salary Advance Pilot App — Project Brief

## Overview

Bohikor2 is a salary advance pilot app. Employees can request a one-time 10,000 XAF advance, paid instantly via Campay mobile money.

## Current Scope (Epic 2): Request & Payout

Users who have completed authentication (Epic 1) can now request an advance and receive funds. Admins can monitor requests.

## Auth (Epic 1 — Complete)

- **Admin:** Email/password via Firebase → verified against `admins` table → dashboard with Invite + Users
- **Mobile:** Phone login (returning) or email invite → email OTP → phone OTP → user created → home

## Request Flow (Epic 2 — Complete)

### Mobile

1. User taps "Request Advance" on home screen
2. Confirmation modal: informs user that advance + charges will be deducted from salary per terms
3. Backend checks: user exists, is active, has accepted terms, no active request in progress
4. Request created with `status = 'initiated'`
5. Backend calls Campay Withdraw API (`POST /withdraw/`) to send 10,000 XAF to user's phone number
6. Campay processes payout → sends webhook to backend
7. Backend verifies webhook JWT signature (HS256, embedded in body), updates request status (`pending` → `SUCCESSFUL` or `FAILED`)
8. User sees request in transaction history with live status

### Eligibility (for now)

- User must exist and be `active`
- User must have `is_terms_accepted = true`
- No existing request with status `initiated` or `pending` (prevent duplicate in-flight requests)
- ~~Request window 15th–end of month~~ — **deferred**
- ~~Daily attempt limit~~ — **deferred**
- ~~Monthly success limit~~ — **deferred**

### Terms Handling

- Terms are accepted via a dedicated screen in the mobile app (separate from auth)
- Stored on `users` table: `is_terms_accepted`, `terms_accepted_at`, `terms_version`, `user_ip_at_consent`
- Before any advance request, backend checks `is_terms_accepted = true`
- If not accepted, return error prompting user to accept terms first
- Terms text is hardcoded in the mobile app for now (no versioning system needed yet)

### Admin Dashboard

- **Requests page:** Table showing all advance requests — user email, amount, status, created date, payout reference, failure reason
- **Users page:** Already exists (from Epic 1)
- **Invite page:** Already exists (from Epic 1)

## Campay Integration

- **Withdraw API** (`POST /withdraw/`) — send money to user's mobile money wallet (status: `SUCCESSFUL`, `FAILED`, `PENDING`)
- **Webhook** — receive payout status updates (JWT HS256 signed, embedded as `signature` field in body)
- **JWT verification** — verify webhook signatures using `CAMPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` via `golang-jwt`
- **Auth** — permanent access token (`Authorization: Token <token>`)
- All credentials configured in backend `.env`

## Future (Deferred)

- Kill switch (block new requests, flag in-flight for review)
- Request window enforcement (15th–end of month, Africa/Douala)
- Daily attempt limit (1/day), monthly success limit (1/month)
- Post-payout satisfaction survey
- Payout speed metrics (P50/P90)
- Push/SMS/email notifications
- Events log page on admin dashboard
- Admin management page
